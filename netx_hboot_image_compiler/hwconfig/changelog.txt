  Removed support for netx 90 MPW.
  Accepts chip types netx90 and netx90_mpw, but treats both as netx90.

* Added various peripherals

* Pass version/chiptype information from HWConfig XML and peripherals.xml to the HBoot template

* Add configuration overlay files to HWconfig tool.

* Temporary: The path argument of list_dynamic_cfg is now optional, 
  when called without the path, the path to hwconfig.py is used instad.

* Added subcommands: make_hboot_xml, list_static_cfg, list_dynamic_cfg, list_supported_chips
The previous call to generate a boot image XML file now requires the subcommand make_hboot_xml.


Version 2.0.1
--------------

* Update setup_dpm snippet to v1.1.7: Do not change hif_io_cfg if neither of
  DPM0/SPM0 nor DPM1/SPM1 are configured.

* Bugfix: SDRAM size handover parameter is SDRAM size divided by two.


Version 2.0.0
--------------

* Added a pseudo-peripheral 'general' with attributes 'app_cpu_enable' and
  'idpm_enable'.

* Added attribute 'sdram_size' to SDRAM peripherals.

* Add StartAppCpu snippet to output when 'app_cpu_enable' is specified.

* Added hand over parameters into boot image, including DPM options and SDRAM
  size parameters depending on DPM/SDRAM configuration.

* Update setup DPM code to v1.1.6. 
  - The DPM window is not activated, this needs to be done by the firmware.
  - The IDPM is not activated by default, only when 'idpm_enable' is specified.

* IoConfig for phy0 and phy1/MLED: 
  - MDIO/MII are connected to the internal PHYs.
  - The signal sources for the MLED pins are configured according to the 
    schematic for NXHX 90-JTAG Rev2 (see readme).
  - The MLED pins are not activated and the register is set to the reset value. 
  - Removed PHY0_LED_LINK_IN and PHY1_LED_LINK_IN from the affected pins.

* Versioning: 
  - A version attribute has been added to the top-level peripherals tag in 
    netx90_mpw_peripherals.xml.
  - The version checkig of the input XML file (doc_version) has been removed.

* Add Constraint to check that the input of pin MMIO7 is always disabled.
* Add hif_io_cfg to output structure. 
* Added registers for IDPM (no peripheral yet).

apply_hwconfig and setup_dpm snippets:
* If multiple DPMs are configured, both parallel and serial DPM are at the 
  same address. In both cases, the message "MESSAGE_DPM" is put at the 
  beginning of this area, formerly MESSAGE_DPM_PARALLEL and MESSAGE_DPM_SERIAL.
* If all DPMs are disabled in the configuration, the IDPM is enabled by default.


Version 22.12.2017
-------------------
